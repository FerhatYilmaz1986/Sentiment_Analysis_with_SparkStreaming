Tasks:

Do twitter streaming analysis using Spark streaming
Train machine learning algorithms to perform sentiment analysis based on the training data and classify stream of tweets using Spark MLib
Store the fetched tweets data and their classification results in a database
Submit your codes and report to Canvas
Submit the screenshot of the code to do all the tasks (the running code) to Canvas as well

Train Machine Learning Algorithms and store data to database
	⁃	Uploaded train and test datasets
	⁃	Renamed column names because columns didn’t have names in the raw format
	⁃	Explored datasets briefly by printing schema and counting the distribution of positive and negative classes
	⁃	Created a pipeline consists of:
	⁃	Tokenizer that converts sentences into word tokens
	⁃	Stop words remover that removes stop words such as a, an, the
	⁃	Count vectorizer and IDF transformer, converts text into vectors based on their frequency
	⁃	Label indexer that converts our target column, sentiment into categories; 1 or 0
	⁃	VectorAssembler that converts everything that we done above into a single vector for each tweet
	⁃	Fitted the pipeline to datasets
	⁃	Applied LogisticRegression classifier to the dataset. Training the model was computationally expensive due to data size.
	⁃	Evaluated model performance with BinaryClassificationEvaluator, which uses ROC as an evaluation metric. Model performance is 75.8.
	⁃	Due to performance issues, couldn’t train more complicated algorithms such as RandomForest or XGBoost
	⁃	Predicted new tweets by using the trained model above
	⁃	Saved predictions to parquet file
	⁃	Saved that parquet file to a S3 bucket on AWS
